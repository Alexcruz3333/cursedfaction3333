NFT that acts like a crypto piggy bank—you (or anyone you allow) can keep depositing funds to the NFT, and the current owner can withdraw. Below is a compact, production-ready scaffold: smart contract + simple frontend flow.

PiggyBank NFT — What it does

Mintable ERC-721: each NFT has its own vault.

Deposits: send ETH (and optional ERC-20s) “into” a token’s vault.

Ownership = control: only the current NFT owner can withdraw.

Giftable: anyone can top up your piggy-bank NFT (great for tips, gifts, prize pools).

Balances follow the token: sell/transfer the NFT and the vault balance goes with it.

Optional goal + lock: set a savings goal or a time lock if you want (toggleable).
